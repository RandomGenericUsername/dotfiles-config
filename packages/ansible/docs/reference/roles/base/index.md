# Base Roles

[EMPTY DIRECTORY] The `playbooks/roles/base/` directory is currently empty. No base roles have been implemented yet.

## Purpose

The base roles directory is reserved for fundamental system configuration roles that provide base functionality required by feature roles or for system-wide settings.

## Future Development

When base roles are added, they will be documented here with:
- Role name and purpose
- Variables and their defaults
- Tasks performed
- Dependencies
- Usage examples
